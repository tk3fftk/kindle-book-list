### CSV Format

The exported data includes:

- **Title**: Book title (commas replaced with full-width commas for CSV compatibility)
- **Author**: Author name (commas replaced with full-width commas for CSV compatibility)
- **Format**: Always "Kindle"

### Sequel Merging

The tool automatically detects and merges sequel series using **8 distinct pattern recognition algorithms**:

**Supported Patterns:**
- **Numbered volumes**: `Title(1)`, `Title(2)` → `Title(1-2)` or `Title(1,3,5)` for non-consecutive
- **Full-width brackets**: `Title（１）`, `Title（２）` → `Title（1-2）`
- **Volume format**: `Title9巻`, `Title13巻` → `Title(9,13)巻`
- **Chapter format**: `Title【第1話】`, `Title【第2話】` → `Title【第1-2話】`
- **Collection format**: `Title第一集`, `Title第二集` → `Title第1-2集`
- **Prefix collection**: `1集 Title`, `2集 Title` → `Title(1-2)集` *(NEW: volumes at beginning)*
- **Upper/Lower**: `Title上`, `Title下` → `Title(上・下)`
- **Space + number**: `Title1`, `Title 2`, `Title　3` → `Title(1-3)` for titles with space-separated numbers
- **Title ending number**: `Title1`, `Title2`, `Title3` → `Title(1-3)` for titles ending with numbers

**🎭 Mixed Pattern Support:**
- Series can use **multiple numbering formats** (e.g., `Title(2,3,4)` + `Title１１` → `Title(2,3,4,11)`)
- Author variants are automatically normalized for better grouping

### Export Methods

**Download Original Data**:
```javascript
downloadCSV()
```

- Creates a file named `kindle_books_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- Downloads original collected data
- Automatically downloads to your default download folder

**Download Merged Data**:
```javascript
downloadMergedCSV()
```

- Creates a file named `kindle_books_merged_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- Downloads data with sequel series merged
- Significantly reduces duplicate entries

**Copy to Clipboard**:
```javascript
copyCSV()         // Copy original data
copyMergedCSV()   // Copy merged data
```

- Copies CSV data directly to clipboard
- Perfect for pasting into spreadsheet applications

## 🔧 How It Works

The script uses DOM selectors to identify book entries on Kindle library pages:

- **Book Titles**: Extracted from `div[role="heading"][aria-level="4"]` elements
- **Authors**: Extracted from `div[id^="content-author-"]` elements
- **Navigation**: Uses pagination buttons with ID pattern `#page-{number}`

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. **Initialize**: Script automatically initializes when pasted
2. **Collect**: Gathers books from current page
   ```
   📖 Book Title 1 by Author A
   📖 Book Title 2 by Author B
   ✅ Added 25 books from this page. Total: 25
   ```
3. **Navigate**: Automatically moves to next page
   ```
   🔄 Moving from page 1 to page 2...
   ```
4. **Complete**: Shows final results
   ```
   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
   📚 Collection complete! Total books: 347
   💾 Use downloadCSV() or copyCSV() to export data
   🔗 Use mergeSequels() to combine sequel series
   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
   ```

5. **Optional**: Merge sequel series
   ```
   🔄 Merging sequels from 347 books...
   🔗 Mixed patterns detected for "Series C" by Author A: numberedVolumes, titleEndingNumber
   📚 Merged: Series A (21 volumes) -> Series A(1-21)
   📚 Merged: Series B (9 volumes) -> Series B(1-9)集
   📚 Merged: Series C (14 volumes) [Mixed: numberedVolumes,titleEndingNumber] -> Series C(2-13)
   ✅ Merge complete!
   📊 Original: 347 books
   📊 Merged: 298 entries
   📊 Series merged: 52
   📊 Standalone books: 246
   🔗 Mixed pattern series: 3
   💾 Use downloadMergedCSV() to download merged CSV
   ```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script doesn't find books**:

- Ensure you're on the correct Kindle library page
